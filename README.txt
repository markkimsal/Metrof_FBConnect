There are 2 installation methods.

When Should I Use the Simple Installation?
================================================================================
Use the simple installation if:
  * You are not a developer or administrator
  * This is your first time installing the plugin
  * You have not made any changes to this module's translation files.
  * You have not made any changes to this module's template files.


When Should I Use the Advanced Installation?
================================================================================
Use the advanced installation if:
  * You are a developer or administrator and you want to understand this module
  * You have made changes to this module's translations
  * You have made changes to this module's templates.


How do I Install the Simple Installation?
================================================================================
Simply copy the "app/" folder to your Magento installation.  This will probalby 
involve using an FTP client to copy the files up to your server.  Nothing 
will be overwritten except any previous installation of the Metrof_FBConnect
module.


How do I Install the Advanced Installation?
================================================================================
Follow the instructions in the file "INSTALL"

Both installation procedures contain the exact same files, but each installation 
folder has the files in a different folder configuration.
